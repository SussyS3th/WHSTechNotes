I set up my journal today.

In my opinion, the new phone law is not effective. It is supposed to encourage more communication with others and also help reduce cheating, but doesn't really get the job done. Since school started there have been numerous fights, including neighboor high schools. 
Although cheating will be more obvious, the class and grade level averages will drop. Overall, the phone ban needs some tweeks to be effective. I would allo phones during fields trips and make it so you can use your phone at lunch. 
A change like that would allow students to connect with each other through a more comfortable medium.

The software engineering field, you use computer science to code different apps for a variety of platforms. With the the of AI, you can even shift your focus to larger parts of a projects and have AI assist you or complete lesser and simpler tasks. The video states there are a lot of social problems that could really leverage the use of computer science. This shows that computer science can hasten the amount of work software engineers can complete, increasing their productivity.

AI helps society in the medical field by improving diagnostic accuracy and speeding up drug discovery. By analyzing medical images, AI can detect diseases like cancer and diabetic retinopathy earlier and with higher precision than human experts alone. In drug development, AI processes vast datasets of chemical compounds to identify promising new therapies, reducing the time and cost associated with bringing life-saving medications to market. Additionally, AI enables personalized treatment plans, utilizing patient-specific information like genetics and lifestyle to recommend the most effective solutions. This technology also streamlines administrative tasks, allowing healthcare professionals to focus more on direct patient care and reducing the potential for human error.

Working in a virtual store for real money is a good idea for the future of jobs. IKEA is actually hiring people to work in its virtual Roblox store, paying them a real hourly wage for tasks like restocking and customer service. This experiment is especially relevant for younger generations, who spend significant time on platforms like Roblox. The company is also blurring the lines between the digital and physical worlds of work. This is a positive step because it demonstrates how the digital economy can create new forms of work that are accessible to younger people. It provides a way for people to earn real income and gain valuable experience by performing digital tasks, which can serve as a stepping stone to other opportunities.

The viral "67 joke" is a current social media trend with no real meaning. Essentially, it's a nonsensical phrase repeated by young people. This is a classic form of "brain rot," where they follow a trend without knowing its origin. The joke involves repeating "67," sometimes with specific hand movements. It adds nothing to the conversation. Some adults find this confusing and annoying.

If I were in charge of school rules, I would allow phones, gaming, and certain artificial intelligence tools. Phones are a tool that can make specific tasks easier, such as allowing the use of QR codes and direct communication with the teacher. Gaming would be a way for more students to connect and bond with each other. Depending on the game, it is also another form of working in a high-stress environment. The unbanning of phones and video games would also allow the students to relax and take a break from the stress of homework, projects, and reviews. While some students might use AI to blatantly cheat, there are other AI tools that can help programmers, like myself, code more easily. AI can also help make test questions and reviews for students to increase their productivity, making studying a breeze. Overall, these tools can increase school test scores and improve the general vibe of the school, shifting it from gloomy to bright.

link to website: https://java-variable-quiz.my.canva.site/

The prompt was to create a quiz/ review tool to go over variables in java. Canva interpreted it as a prompt to give me code in return, but after it completed that, it opened a tab that put all the code into an interactive window where I could take the test. There is even a feature that tells you what to remember if you get a question wrong so you can get closer to the right answer and I didn't even ask it to do that. To improve the prompt and the final product be better would be to have it longer and make the questions increase in difficulty if you get the previous question right. Alternatively, I could have Canva make the test infinite or until the user gets a certain number of questions right before letting them exit. Adding a final test without help at the end would make this website even more efficient.
