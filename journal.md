In my opinion, the new phone law is not effective. It is supposed to encourage more communication with others and also help reduce cheating, but doesn't really get the job done. Since school started there have been numerous fights, including neighboor high schools. 
Although cheating will be more obvious, the class and grade level averages will drop. Overall, the phone ban needs some tweeks to be effective. I would allo phones during fields trips and make it so you can use your phone at lunch. 
A change like that would allow students to connect with each other through a more comfortable medium.

AI helps society in the medical field by improving diagnostic accuracy and speeding up drug discovery. By analyzing medical images, AI can detect diseases like cancer and diabetic retinopathy earlier and with higher precision than human experts alone. In drug development, AI processes vast datasets of chemical compounds to identify promising new therapies, reducing the time and cost associated with bringing life-saving medications to market. Additionally, AI enables personalized treatment plans, utilizing patient-specific information like genetics and lifestyle to recommend the most effective solutions. This technology also streamlines administrative tasks, allowing healthcare professionals to focus more on direct patient care and reducing the potential for human error.

Working in a virtual store for real money is a good idea for the future of jobs. IKEA is actually hiring people to work in its virtual Roblox store, paying them a real hourly wage for tasks like restocking and customer service. This experiment is especially relevant for younger generations, who spend significant time on platforms like Roblox. The company is also blurring the lines between the digital and physical worlds of work. This is a positive step because it demonstrates how the digital economy can create new forms of work that are accessible to younger people. It provides a way for people to earn real income and gain valuable experience by performing digital tasks, which can serve as a stepping stone to other opportunities.
