In my opinion, the new phone law is not effective. It is supposed to encourage more communication with others and also help reduce cheating, but doesn't really get the job done. Since school started there have been numerous fights, including neighboor high schools. 
Although cheating will be more obvious, the class and grade level averages will drop. Overall, the phone ban needs some tweeks to be effective. I would allo phones during fields trips and make it so you can use your phone at lunch. 
A change like that would allow students to connect with each other through a more comfortable medium.

The software engineering field, you use computer science to code different apps for a variety of platforms. With the the of AI, you can even shift your focus to larger parts of a projects and have AI assist you or complete lesser and simpler tasks. The video states there are a lot of social problems that could really leverage the use of computer science. This shows that computer science can hasten the amount of work software engineers can complete, increasing their productivity.

AI helps society in the medical field by improving diagnostic accuracy and speeding up drug discovery. By analyzing medical images, AI can detect diseases like cancer and diabetic retinopathy earlier and with higher precision than human experts alone. In drug development, AI processes vast datasets of chemical compounds to identify promising new therapies, reducing the time and cost associated with bringing life-saving medications to market. Additionally, AI enables personalized treatment plans, utilizing patient-specific information like genetics and lifestyle to recommend the most effective solutions. This technology also streamlines administrative tasks, allowing healthcare professionals to focus more on direct patient care and reducing the potential for human error.
