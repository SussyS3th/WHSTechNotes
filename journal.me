I set up my journal today.

In my opinion, the new phone law is not effective. It is supposed to encourage more communication with others and also help reduce cheating, but doesn't really get the job done. Since school started there have been numerous fights, including neighboor high schools. 
Although cheating will be more obvious, the class and grade level averages will drop. Overall, the phone ban needs some tweeks to be effective. I would allo phones during fields trips and make it so you can use your phone at lunch. 
A change like that would allow students to connect with each other through a more comfortable medium.
